Office Hours 
------------
All office hours will either be fully **in-person/remote (on Zoom)** or **hybrid (in-person/remote)**. Please read the sections below on how each type of office hour is held.


Fully In-Person Office Hours 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fully in-person office hours will be held at a designated location in JCL. You will meet with the TA and/or instructor 
and ask questions and get help on material/assignments. There is no sign-up for in-person office hours on Ed. However, the
TA/instructor will ensure that everyone gets fair share of time for there concerns to be addressed. 


Hybrid/Fully Remote Office Hours 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With hybrid and remote office hours the course staff will be working individually wiht each student. Right before the beginning of an office hour, 
an Ed sign-up post will be created to  allow you to claim a spot to be seen. Please know that not all 
students will be able to  be seen during an office hour but we will try our best to accommodation everyone. Even if 
you are coming in-person **you must sign up when the post is goes live**, Do not walk in  in-person until 
the TA/instructor indicates you can enter the room. We may be seeing a remote student at the time. 

Here is the information that you will see when the hybrid/remote office hours post goes up:  

    **In-person instructions (if hybrid office hours)**

    Please make sure to sign up even if you are coming in-person. Please provide an explanation for 
    why are you coming and be close by the office hour location. We will let you know when you can enter.

    **Remote instructions**

    In this post, add a comment with a brief description of your issue, and a Zoom meeting ID for remote 
    students (this can be your personal meeting ID or one created specifically for office hours). The 
    instructor or TA running office hours will go through these messages and visit each meeting to 
    provide one-on-one help. Note: If you are uncomfortable sharing a meeting ID on the channel, 
    simply specify that you would like the instructor/TA to send you a private message once they’re 
    reading to see you, so you can then share a meeting ID with them privately. When an instructor or 
    TA joins your meeting, please share your screen with them if your question is going to involve 
    looking at code or debugging of any sort (if you prefer, you can also share a single window, 
    such as your code editor or a terminal). This is similar to how you would show an instructor/TA 
    your laptop during normal office hours. During office hours, you may be asked to grant control 
    to the instructor/TA over your screen. This can sometimes allow us to help you more interactively 
    (similar to how an instructor/TA would type on your laptop during normal office hours), but please 
    let us know if you would prefer not to do this. You will know when you are coming up soon because 
    the instructor or TA will click the “Resolved” button to indicate we have completed a session.
