M2: Unix Processes & Management
================================
This module explores Unix programs and processes—how they’re created, scheduled, grouped, signaled, and managed by the kernel. Students will use standard tools to inspect system activity, understand process lifecycles and job control, and connect concepts to practice with a brief, hands-on introduction to C. 

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain the difference between a program and a process, and describe process lifecycles (creation, running, waiting/sleeping, stopped, zombie).
- Inspect and interpret process information using tools such as ps, top/htop. 
- Define and distinguish process groups, sessions, and a controlling terminal. 
- Use job control in the shell: background/foreground tasks (&, jobs, fg, bg), Ctrl+Z. 
- Send and handle signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGHUP, SIGTSTP, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE) via kill; understand default actions and safe shutdown patterns.
- Explain how the kernel schedules processes (priorities/niceness, time slices) and adjust behavior with nice/renice.
