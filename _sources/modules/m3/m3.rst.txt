M3: Interacting with the Kernel
==================================
This third module explores how processes begin to interact with the operating system and kernel. Specifically, when a process needs to request an operating system service such as system call request. We will begin by learning more advanced C topics that specifically  interacts with the kernel. 

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Distinguish system calls from library calls and explain the user↔kernel transition. 
- Understand The syscall path: user mode → kernel mode → return
- Create new processes with fork() and manage parent/child control flow correctly.
- Reap children and handle termination states using wait()/waitpid(); diagnose zombies and orphans.
- Declare, pass, and manipulate pointers correctly, including const correctness and basic pointer arithmetic.
- alocate, and free dynamic memory with malloc/calloc/free, avoiding leaks 
- Understand Common memory bugs: leaks, use-after-free, and dangling pointers

Pre-recorded Lectures
---------------------
**Note: Professor Samuels will state on Ed when the prerecorded videos are ready to be viewed each week for a module.**

The pre-recorded lectures are available here: `M3 Videos <https://uchicago.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=d1b231ad-56b5-4ce3-9094-b38d00061802>`_.
