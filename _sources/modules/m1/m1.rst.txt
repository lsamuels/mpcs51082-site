M1: The Unix Shell 
===========================
This module introduces the Unix shell as both a command interpreter and a programming environment. Students will learn how to effectively navigate the shell, automate tasks with Bash scripting, and leverage key text processing utilities. The module also covers customization of the shell environment and configuration files to improve productivity.
 
By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Write and execute basic Bash scripts to automate common tasks.  
2. Use essential text processing and filtering commands such as ``cut``, ``sort``, ``uniq``, ``tail``, ``grep``, and ``sed``.  
3. Understand and modify the shell environment and configuration files (e.g., ``.bashrc``).  
4. Use the command history effectively to recall, repeat, and edit previously executed commands.
