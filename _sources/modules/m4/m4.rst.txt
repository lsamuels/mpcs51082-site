Module 4: Advanced Unix Kernel Subsystems
=========================================

- Deep dive into filesystem architecture (including VFS), file I/O in C, virtual memory, and basic Unix networking tools.


By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain how the Virtual File System (VFS) abstracts concrete filesystems.
- Write robust C programs that open, modify, and close files using POSIX APIs with correct error handling.
- Describe virtual memory concepts (paging, page cache).
- Use core Unix networking commands to inspect connectivity, and name resolution.
